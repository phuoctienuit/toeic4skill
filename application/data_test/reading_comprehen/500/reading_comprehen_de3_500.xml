		Connect the lead from the charger to be bottom of your cellular phone or to a charging stand. The plug the charger into a standard wall outlet. When the battery is charging, the battery strength indicator on the right side of the display scrolls.<br/><br/>

Note: when you charge the battery for the first time, the battery strength indicator will not scroll the entire time; this is normal.<br/><br/>

If your phone displays NOT CHARGING, charging is suspended. Check that the battery is connected to an approved charging device. If the battery is very hot or cold, wait for a while; charging will automatically resume after the battery is restored to its normal operating state. If charging still fails, contact your dealer.<br/><br/>
