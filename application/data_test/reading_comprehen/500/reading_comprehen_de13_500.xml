		The CEO of Telcorp, Howard Ballantine, has been accused of using company money to invest in personal real estate deals. 
		A private committee was hired to investigate Mr Ballantine’s financial activity after Walter Scott,
		the senior accountant at Telcorp, noticed nearly 2 million dollars was missing from the company’s primary investment account.
		Mr. Scott discovered the problem three months ago and reported it to Richard Flint, Telcorp’s chief financial advisor. 
		Howard Ballantine denies any wrongdoing, and is hiring his own team of financial officers to investigate the matter, 
		a close friend of Ballantine’s said. Telcorp was the nation’s leading producer of cell phones until Softphone Inc. 
		opened a factory in China six months ago, which enabled it to save nearly 10 million dollars in production costs. 
		Mr. Ballantine’s alleged actions suggest that the company will face more trouble in the future.

		Dear Mr. Johnson,

		We received your request to change the dates of your reservation at the Glenwood Resort from April 15-22 to June 20-28.
		Unfortunately, I have checked the database and there are no rooms available for those dates. I sincerely apologize that 
		we cannot accommodate your request; unfortunately June, July, and August are our busiest months because we offer special 
		summer discounts. I understand that your company is relocating you to London in July and therefore you can’t make a reservation
		for any other date. I would like to mention, however, that Philip D. Humboldt, the owner of Glenwood Resort, recently opened 
		another luxury resort, Woodshire Retreat, just thirty minutes outside of Mulberry. If you would like to make a reservation 
		at this resort, the number is 1-800-238-9648. Or you can make a reservation online at www.humboldthotels.com.

		Attention All Employees!
		The executives at Juniper Insurance have decided to purchase mobile phones for all employees. 
		They are hoping that the new phones will improve communication between members of different departments. 
		The company will be purchasing forty-seven TM-161 cell phones from Globalphone Inc. at the end of July.
		You will receive your new phone during the first week of August. Each employee will be given 200 minutes free each month. 
		If you use more than your monthly limit, you will be charged an additional $25 each month. 
		We understand that this is a new policy that may potentially be problematic, so we welcome any comments or suggestions you may have. 
		To monitor the new phone system’s effectiveness, we will be asking employees to fill out a survey. 
		The date for this survey has not been chosen yet. However, it will most likely take place during the third week of August. 
		Also, employees with other suggestions about how to help employees communicate better should fill out an Employee Comments Form,
		which can be obtained from Betty Gill in the Human Resources Department.

		The meeting with Gilman Electronics was rescheduled from Friday, April 22, to Monday, May 25. 
		I received an e-mail from their CEO, Robert Towney, informing me that Gilman Electronics is not ready to introduce 
		the new computers due to production delays. Apparently, technicians discovered a serious defect in one of the microchips 
		and consequently all of the computers have to be re-evaluated. Therefore, we have about a month to work on the advertising campaign. 
		I recommend that we meet early next week- perhaps Monday or Wednesday – to discuss the current ad campaign and
		determine whether or not we want to change it now that we have some extra time. Please e-mail me by 4 p.m. 
		today with your comments or suggestions about the Gilman account. As you know, Gilman is our biggest client
		so it is critical that we provide the best service possible.

		Re:               Appointment Cancellation

		Mr. Walker,

		I apologize for having to cancel our appointment last Friday at the last minute.
		There was some urgent business at another job site, and I had to attend to it personally.
		I hope that we can reschedule for sometime next week.

		Also, in your last e-mail you asked for some different options with regard to materials and our turn-around time. 
		The sample books I couriered to you last week are the standard wallpapers that we use – 1.75 meter-wide, printed.
		But we have also started using a new process with large, floor-to-ceiling rolls that produces a papered wall without seams. 
		The papers are the highest grade, and most have silk highlights. As your project is a luxury apartment complex,
		these products may better suit your needs. This is a specialty process, requiring special equipment,
		and so there would be additional charges on top of our usual labor costs. 
		Since you would be doing so many units in your building, perhaps we could offer you a discounted rate on the labor. 
		I will discuss this possibility with our sales manager and let you know when we meet.

		With regard to our turn-around time, using standard-process papers we would be able to complete the 15 units in one week. 
		The seamless wallpaper application process makes use of a large roller mechanism; 
		so, potentially, we could complete the work in 3 days. Again, I am sorry to cancel our appointment. 
		Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to reschedule. Thank you.

		Sincerely,
		Peter Lasco
		Sales Rep,
		All Walls, Inc.
