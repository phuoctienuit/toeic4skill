		Those old Movie Goer magazines in the basement may be worth more than you would imagine. A 152 copy featuring Clark Gable can be worth over $750 and an old Lucille Ball is valued at $900. But it’s not just the oldies that are worth so much money. A collection of twenty-five Lost in Space covers form June, 2001 sells for more than $450 online. “The internet has been great for collecting and has made it a lot easier to find things”, says George Boulis, 58, a Boston based collector who has all the Movie Goer Magazine covers. They’re worth about $28000. And what do you think is the most valuable issue? The first one, of course: a mint-condition copy goes for more than $1850.

		<b>MEMORANDUM</b><br/><br/>

To: All Atlantis Corporation Employees<br/>
From: Myrtle Sternbridge, Chief Financial Officer<br/>
Re: Two-day unpaid leave<br/>
Date: June 3<br/><br/>

It is my unhappy duty to inform you that the Board of Directors has voted to impose a two-day layoff for all employees in order to avoid an operating budget shortfall.<br/><br/>

The company is facing a serious crisis due to poor profits over the past two quarters. The budget is short by about $13 million and according to our bylaw, the budget must be balanced by June 30, the end of this fiscal year.<br/><br/>

It is necessary for all employees to give up  two days’ pay in order to put an end to the budget crisis. Employees are to speak to their supervisors regarding scheduling the two days that they are not to report to work.<br/><br/>

According to the agreement reached between Atlantis Corp. and the union, employees will be reimbursed for the days they lose during the first six months of the next fiscal year if profits improve.<br/><br/>

I sincerely regret the need to take such drastic measures to end the current budget crisis, but with your cooperation, we can see this through.]]>
