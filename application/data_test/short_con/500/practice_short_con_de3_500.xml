		M: What would you like to do with your hair today? Would you like some highlights or something dramatic done to it?<br>

		W: I’d like something simple, like the receptionist’s style. Can you add some highlights to make my hair look similar to hers?<br>

		M: Of course. I actually just completed a “what’s hot” seminar last week in  New York, and that style was one that we focused on.<br>

		W: Oh, did you? You make me feel more comfortable and excited about the changes to my hair

		W: Richard, have you gotten your new parking pass? I picked mine up on Tuesday.<br>

		M: Tuesday! No, I haven’t even gotten a call for mine. I have to get the parking attendant to lift the gate for me every day.<br>

		W: Maybe, you should contact someone in HR about getting you a card<br>

		M: Good idea. I’ll call them right after the meeting

		M: Is this monitor available in black or silver?<br>

		W: Currently, we only have the white one in stock, but if you’d like we can order either the black or the silver. You can also get a 21-inch model for an additional 200 dollars.<br>

		M: I’d rather order the 17-inch in black. I heard that silver paint tends to look old quickly.<br>

		W: Great, then let’s go to the customer service counter to fill out the forms. You should have your new monitor within 10 business days.
