		There are a number of professions in which employees must work long hours. In my opinion, this is only acceptable when the nature of the job demands it. First of all, it should be mentioned that there is a difference between working irregular hours and unsociable hours. Some people work very long hours, for various reasons. They probably work a longer working week than average. They may have a difficult job or be very ambitious. Working long hours in this way is unnecessary. It is often because there is a “long-hours culture” in a company or industry. In addition some people go into an industry in which unsocial hours are the norm. For example, the retail sector has expanded its opening hours in recent years, which means that employees have to work longer and more unsociable hours as more and more shops open longer. In general, these working hours are not essential, but social pressure and market demands have allowed them to become the norm.

		In contract, there are certain profession in which working long unsociable hours is not only necessary and usual but essential. The medical profession is a good example of this. People depend on having access to medical staff in an emergency twenty-four hours a day, the quality of care for patients would go down. Other examples of these professions are the emergency services, such as the police and fire service. Police officers and fire fighters would be unable to do their jobs if they worked a typical 9-to-5 workday. On the other hand, working excessively long hours can compromise people’s ability to do their jobs. For example, junior doctors often work in excess of one hundred hours per week. Sometimes they are so tired that they could make an incorrect diagnosis or prescription.

		In conclusion, it is my opinion that workers should only be required to work long hours when the job demands it, but that this needs to be balanced with concern for their own and the public’s safety.

		Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
		Television has broken down communication among family and friends.
		Give reasons or examples to support your opinion.

		Some might suggest that television is beneficial bringing the whole family together. Although it seems that whole family is watching TV together, they are not together anymore. While people watch TV, people talk less. For the worse, people can watch TV through separate medium as more computers and personal medium are available nowadays.
 
		Child nowadays certainly talk less because they watch TV more than before. While people watch TV or play computer game, they don’t need to communicate with others, but only concentrate on the image moving on the screen. Thus, kids watch TV overly tend to lack communication skills. This will cause communication problems among friends and family. Increasing violence in elementary school may be the result of lack of children’s social skills.
 
		Plus, as personal medium are populated, many families get to have one TV and one computer per house. Some get to have two TVs per house. This enables each family member to watch or do whatever one wants. This definitely takes time out for family to be together.
 
		I believe that TV prevents children from developing communication skills and physically takes family time away.
		I suggest people turn TVs off at least for an hour a day and do anything together at home: it can be a game or gardening or can be anything. By turning off TV only for an hour will help family be together and grow communication skills.
