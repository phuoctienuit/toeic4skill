		It is this firm’s opinion that our clients avoid the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of the Omega Corporation. There are too many (1)……… questions concerning the business model of Omega, so it unknown whether the company will be successful in the long term. Considering that there are three known cases of scientists at Omega (2)……… their research in the company’s core sectors, we feel that they are not worthy of trust. Reliable sources indicate that the government is preparing to (3)……… a lawsuit against the company. If this lawsuit should go through, there is no doubt in our minds that the company will declare bankruptcy. In short, it would be folly to invest any money in this corporation.

		Dear Sirs,<br/><br/>

Although I am sure you are used to receiving letters from dissatisfied (1)……….., I am writing to thank you for you the kind treatment I received from two of your store (2)………..earlier this week. I was doing my weekly shopping when I began to feel dizzy. It appears that I passed out.<br/><br/>

When I came to, a very nice young woman took me to the (3)……….. break room. She gave mea glass of water, and taking my shopping list, asked one of the packing staff (a middle-aged gentleman) to gather up all the items on the list.<br/><br/>
 
This kind man then drove me home with the grocery items which he had kindly picked up for me. I am most grateful to both these people. Please (4)………..my thanks to them.<br/><br/>
 
Sincerely,<br/>
