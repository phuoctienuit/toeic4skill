		Do you like French food? If so, you will love Chateau Francois, on the corner of John Street and Richardson Avenue. 
		Stop by for dinner to enjoy traditional French cuisine: escargot, homemade bread, and fine wines. 
		For dessert, why don’t you try pastries with fresh fruit and rich dark chocolate? 
		The thing that makes Chateau Francois truly unique is the restaurant’s location. 
		Our newly-designed chef’s deck overlooks our estate vineyards and the beautiful Potemac  River.
		Enjoy the view as you relax over a glass of wine. We look forward to seeing you for dinner.
