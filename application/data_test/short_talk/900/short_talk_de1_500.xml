		Hello. My name is Claudia and I am happy to be your host and guide this afternoon.
		It’s currently 12:30 and we will begin our tour of the facilities at 1:00. 
		But before we get started, I do have a few announcements to make. 
		Unfortunately, we do not allow any visitors to photograph the equipment or video the baking process. 
		The first part of the tour will finish at 2 p. m. 
		However, you will have a couple of unguided hours to visit our labs and tasting rooms before you leave the premises. 
		Feel free to ask any questions that you may have at anytime throughout the tour. I do hope that you enjoy your visit.

		I am pleased announce the grand opening of Atlas Steels Corporation here in Hamilton.
		As directed operations, I can only try to express how proud I am.
		We will open the plant doors in early July and will look at hiring an additional 100 staff members, 
		and then closer to the end of the year we will most likely bring on another 75 people. 
		We’ve expanded quite a bit since our first production facility in Milton, 
		to our present day plants in Portland, Rochester, St. Louis, and now here in Hamilton. 
		We are looking forward to joining the community.

		Do you like French food? If so, you will love Chateau Francois, on the corner of John Street and Richardson Avenue. 
		Stop by for dinner to enjoy traditional French cuisine: escargot, homemade bread, and fine wines. 
		For dessert, why don’t you try pastries with fresh fruit and rich dark chocolate? 
		The thing that makes Chateau Francois truly unique is the restaurant’s location. 
		Our newly-designed chef’s deck overlooks our estate vineyards and the beautiful Potemac  River.
		Enjoy the view as you relax over a glass of wine. We look forward to seeing you for dinner.

		Starting next month we’ll be introducing the company’s new database computer system. The new network will combine a few features that will help us to stay connected more efficiently, especially on group tasks. Please remember that all files from the old database will not be moved to the new one, so it’s essential that all staff back up their files by the end of the month. If you fail to do so. Important data could be lost. The full network will require two weeks to install
