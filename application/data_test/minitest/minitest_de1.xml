		Hello. My name is Claudia and I am happy to be your host and guide this afternoon.
		It’s currently 12:30 and we will begin our tour of the facilities at 1:00. 
		But before we get started, I do have a few announcements to make. 
		Unfortunately, we do not allow any visitors to photograph the equipment or video the baking process. 
		The first part of the tour will finish at 2 p. m. 
		However, you will have a couple of unguided hours to visit our labs and tasting rooms before you leave the premises. 
		Feel free to ask any questions that you may have at anytime throughout the tour. I do hope that you enjoy your visit.

		I am pleased announce the grand opening of Atlas Steels Corporation here in Hamilton.
		As directed operations, I can only try to express how proud I am.
		We will open the plant doors in early July and will look at hiring an additional 100 staff members, 
		and then closer to the end of the year we will most likely bring on another 75 people. 
		We’ve expanded quite a bit since our first production facility in Milton, 
		to our present day plants in Portland, Rochester, St. Louis, and now here in Hamilton. 
		We are looking forward to joining the community.

		Do you like French food? If so, you will love Chateau Francois, on the corner of John Street and Richardson Avenue. 
		Stop by for dinner to enjoy traditional French cuisine: escargot, homemade bread, and fine wines. 
		For dessert, why don’t you try pastries with fresh fruit and rich dark chocolate? 
		The thing that makes Chateau Francois truly unique is the restaurant’s location. 
		Our newly-designed chef’s deck overlooks our estate vineyards and the beautiful Potemac  River.
		Enjoy the view as you relax over a glass of wine. We look forward to seeing you for dinner.

		I am writing to let you know of the exemplary care and service I received form (1)……… staff during my stay at the Tinkum Square Hotel last July. From the moment of my arrival until the day I (2)………, I received nothing but courteous and efficient service from all members of the hotel staff.<br/><br/>

I especially want to bring to your attention two staff members who provided me with assistance above and beyond the call of duty. On my way to the airport after a pleasant week at Tinkum Square, I discovered that I had left my computer behind. I immediately called the manager on duty, Robert Dunstan who supervised an emergency search for my computer. After it was discovered in the hotel restaurant, Mr. Dunstan’s assistant, Martha Jones, got into a taxi and personally delivered the computer to me at the airport. It was all done so (3)……… that I had my computer in hand well before I had to board the plane.<br/><br/>

I know that you would want to hear about this example of the loyalty and professionalism of Mr. Dunstan and Ms. Jones. I look forward to meeting at Tinkum Square during my next business trip to Portsmouth.<br/><br/>

Sincerely,<br/>
James L.Keeman<br/>]]>

		Those old Movie Goer magazines in the basement may be worth more than you would imagine. A 152 copy featuring Clark Gable can be worth over $750 and an old Lucille Ball is valued at $900. But it’s not just the oldies that are worth so much money. A collection of twenty-five Lost in Space covers form June, 2001 sells for more than $450 online. “The internet has been great for collecting and has made it a lot easier to find things”, says George Boulis, 58, a Boston based collector who has all the Movie Goer Magazine covers. They’re worth about $28000. And what do you think is the most valuable issue? The first one, of course: a mint-condition copy goes for more than $1850.

		<b>MEMORANDUM</b><br/><br/>

To: All Atlantis Corporation Employees<br/>
From: Myrtle Sternbridge, Chief Financial Officer<br/>
Re: Two-day unpaid leave<br/>
Date: June 3<br/><br/>

It is my unhappy duty to inform you that the Board of Directors has voted to impose a two-day layoff for all employees in order to avoid an operating budget shortfall.<br/><br/>

The company is facing a serious crisis due to poor profits over the past two quarters. The budget is short by about $13 million and according to our bylaw, the budget must be balanced by June 30, the end of this fiscal year.<br/><br/>

It is necessary for all employees to give up  two days’ pay in order to put an end to the budget crisis. Employees are to speak to their supervisors regarding scheduling the two days that they are not to report to work.<br/><br/>

According to the agreement reached between Atlantis Corp. and the union, employees will be reimbursed for the days they lose during the first six months of the next fiscal year if profits improve.<br/><br/>

I sincerely regret the need to take such drastic measures to end the current budget crisis, but with your cooperation, we can see this through.]]>
