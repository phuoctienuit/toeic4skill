Dear sir,<br/><br/>

I have subscribed to PC Land magazine for two years. My subscription expires every January, (1)……… my subscription fees are automatically taken from my bank account by direct debit. This is a method I chose (2)……… it is very convenient and allows me to continue receiving my magazine.
Unfortunately, I have not received a single issue of PC Land so far this year. I telephoned customer services at the end of January, and they said I would receive my January issue with my February issue. (3)………, I have received nothing, and it is almost the end of March.<br/><br/>

Please sort out this problem, or I will need to ask for a refund.<br/><br/>

Sincerely,<br/>
Harold Windsor<br/>
