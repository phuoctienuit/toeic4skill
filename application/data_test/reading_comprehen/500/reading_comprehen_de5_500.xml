		Dear Mr. and Mrs. Thomas,<br/><br/>

Thank you for joining the World Travel tour to Emerald Island. We look forward to seeing you at the Ocean Breezes Hotel on April 2nd. At your request we have reserved for you an ocean view room with twin beds. Please notify hotel staff in advance of your arrival if you wish to make any changes in this room arrangement.<br/><br/>

When you check in at hotel, mention that you are a participant in the World Travel tour and the staff will inform the tour leader of your arrival. Tour participants will gather in the Ocean Breezes restaurant at 6:30 for dinner and a chance to meet each other. A complete itinerary for the tour will be distributed at that time. The tour leader will explain the tour activities and you will have the opportunity to ask questions.<br/><br/>

Your hotel room and three meals a day at the hotel restaurant are included in the price of the tour. The cost of transportation between the airport and the hotel will be paid by the individual participants. I have enclosed some informational brochures that may be of interest to you. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.<br/><br/>

Sincerely,<br/>
George Harris<br/>
Assistant Director of Tours<br/>
