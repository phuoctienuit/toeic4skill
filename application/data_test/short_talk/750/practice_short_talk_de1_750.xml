		Good afternoon everyone and thank you for coming to this year conference on organizational behavior. My name is Francis Lee and I’ll be chairing the conference for the next three days. Each day we’ll discuss a new area organizational behavior.
A few of the concepts we’ll be covering include hiring practices, group dynamics and project management. Each of you will be responsible for the responding daily to the lectures and posting your responses on our conference website, which also maintains a chat room for you to discuss ideas with your colleagues. Undoubtedly, during the conference, you will benefit both from the lectures themselves, and by interacting with you colleagues. We wish you good luck over the next three days.

		Starting next month we’ll be introducing the company’s new database computer system. The new network will combine a few features that will help us to stay connected more efficiently, especially on group tasks. Please remember that all files from the old database will not be moved to the new one, so it’s essential that all staff back up their files by the end of the month. If you fail to do so. Important data could be lost. The full network will require two weeks to install
