		Hello. My name is Claudia and I am happy to be your host and guide this afternoon.
		It’s currently 12:30 and we will begin our tour of the facilities at 1:00. 
		But before we get started, I do have a few announcements to make. 
		Unfortunately, we do not allow any visitors to photograph the equipment or video the baking process. 
		The first part of the tour will finish at 2 p. m. 
		However, you will have a couple of unguided hours to visit our labs and tasting rooms before you leave the premises. 
		Feel free to ask any questions that you may have at anytime throughout the tour. I do hope that you enjoy your visit.

		I am pleased announce the grand opening of Atlas Steels Corporation here in Hamilton.
		As directed operations, I can only try to express how proud I am.
		We will open the plant doors in early July and will look at hiring an additional 100 staff members, 
		and then closer to the end of the year we will most likely bring on another 75 people. 
		We’ve expanded quite a bit since our first production facility in Milton, 
		to our present day plants in Portland, Rochester, St. Louis, and now here in Hamilton. 
		We are looking forward to joining the community.
