		LONDON – In May, Great Britain’s Home Office, deciding on compensation for a man who served four years in prison for industrial espionage that he did not commit, ruled that he was entitled to about $1.1 million. They sais, however, that he would have to reimburse the prison about $23.000 for four years’ room and board. The outraged Michael O’Brien, age 34, was freed by a Court of Appeal. He said, “They don’t charge guilty people for bed and board. They only charge innocent people!”
