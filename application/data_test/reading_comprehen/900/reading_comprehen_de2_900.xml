		Hours of work

		All employees are expected to be present and on time for every working day. When circumstances prevent you from reporting to work, or when you know in advance that you will be late, you are expected to notify your manager prior to your normal start time.

		If you are absent from work for three consecutive working days for reasons of illness, a doctor’s statement regarding the nature of your illness and verifying consultation time and date may be required. Failure to provide doctor’s verification of illness upon request may result in the time off being classified as an unexcused absence and your pay may be adjusted.

		If you are absent from work without notification, it may be assumed that you are not returning, and we reserve the right to immediately terminate your employment and include a note in your record stating “voluntarily quit without notice”.

		Passage 2:

		March 11th, 2005

		Dear Mr. Witherspoon,

		I’m writing to you in the hopes that you will understand my situation. I trust that by now you will have heard about my situation from my manger. I hope that I can at least be given the chance to explain my side of the story. As for my manager, she is only doing her job, but I do think she has been totally unreasonable in following company policy to the letter and not giving the least bit of consideration to normal human error.

		I was very ill from February 20th to 24th, and I took those days off work to recover. I did not go to the doctor as it was just a case of food poisoning, and all I really needed was bed rest. I did, however, call each day to tell my manager. When I returned to work, she asked me for a doctor’s note, and I told her I couldn’t produce one. That was the last I heard about it until payday when I noticed that my pay was short. I asked my manager about it, and she told me that I wasn’t being paid for the days I was home sick from work. That’s when she told me about the policy. And when I complained, she insisted I bring it up with you.

		Needless to say, I’m very upset that this money was withheld from my pay. It was my understanding that I was allowed to take paid sick days from work, and I’m sorry to say that I had no idea about this policy about having to hand in a doctor’s note. I really need that money as I have a very tight budget this month. It was a mistake, and, had I known, I certainly would have gone to the doctor about my condition. I hope you can understand my situation.

		Yours sincerely,
		Brenda Wilson

		Re: HR Manager Position
		Attachments: Christina_Appleby_resume2007.doc

		Dear Mr. Blake,

		I’m not sure if you remember me. We met at the company Christmas party last year. My name is Christina Appleby, and I work in the information systems department. My manager, Chris Knowles, recently informed me of a position that is opening in the Human Resources department for an HR manager and suggested that I apply for it.

		I have attached my resume for you to look at, and I think you will find that my background is what you are looking for. As you will see, I’ve been working in this industry for more than twelve years, the past five of which I’ve been with this company. I hold an MBA from Sloan MIT. The team that I’ve been in charge of has consistently produced results on schedule, and I feel this demonstrates my ability to manage and motivate others.

		I understand that the position would involve relocating, but this would be fine. My husband is actually considering a job in the same area as it so happens.

		I’d be very pleased to meet with you to discuss my suitability for this position. Thank you for your consideration.

		New Conference Center

		Limited Properties (LP) is proud to announce that it has completed construction on its second conference center in Springfield, Ohio, a spokesman for the company said.
		The first conference center is located next to the Upton Insurance building downtown, and is famous for its golden windows. 
		For three years in a row, this conference building has been the venue for important international seminars and meetings between oil companies. 
		The second conference center is even larger than its predecessor; it has ten more floors and is roughly three times wider. 
		Construction on the second conference center began on March 2, 2004, and was not completed until July 29, 2007. 
		To commemorate its opening, CEO of LP, Robert Henley, is planning a huge dinner, which will take place on August 15. 
		Prominent members of the business community and city officials will attend the event, which will include a five-course meal and live music from the Springfield Harmonic Symphony.

		Dear Mr. Poll,

		I was honored to receive an invitation to the commemoration dinner at the new conference center in Springfield, and I would be delighted to attend. 
		I was in Milan on a business trip when the conference center was completed and I could not wait to get back and see how it looked. 
		I agree with the general consensus that Limited Properties has created a place that is even better than the first conference center. 
		In fact, I would like to host the 4th Annual Business Development Conference at the new facility in September. 
		This year, representatives from Chile, Korea, China, Japan, and Australia will attend the event, and I am confident they would be impressed with the LP Grand Conference Center. 
		Perhaps we could meet at the dinner and discuss this matter further. I look forward to seeing you there.

		Sincerely,
		Charles Gates
		CEO, GMA Oil Corp.

		Dear Mr. Benson,
		 
		I have written to you several times over the past two months requesting an explanation on why you have failed to bring your account with us up-to-date.

		By ignoring these requests, you are damaging the excellent credit record you had previously maintained with our company. In addition, every month that you fail to pay your account, you receive a $25 late payment fee. As of the date of this letter, your account balance is $235.04

		Unless I hear from you within ten days, I will have no other choice but to turn your account over to a debt collection agency. I am sorry that we must take such drastic action but I am afraid you leave us no choice. You can preserve your credit rating by sending us a check for the amount stated above.

		Sincerely,

		Ross Gunter
		Director of Accounting,

		Dear Mr. Benson,
		Thank you for your letter. You deserve an explanation for what went wrong in our accounting department, and I hope that this letter will help resolve our recent error. It has taken a lot of time to find out what happened, so please accept our apologies for the delay in this response.

		A thorough look at our records revealed that we did receive your April payment on time, as you stated in your letter of June 25. However, it was credited to an account which bears a similar name to yours. Therefore, we began sending you our standard notices requesting payment, in keeping with our routine policy.

		I am sorry for all the distress we have caused you. You have been a valued customer of ours for a long time and we appreciate your understanding. To express our sincerest apologies, we would like to send you a $175 gift certificate to The Wilson Spa and Massage Center
